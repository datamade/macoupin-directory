          <p>Macoupin Directory serves as Macoupin County’s online source for finding businesses, local governments and community services across the county.</p>

          <h3>What It Is</h3>
          <p>This state of the art tool allows you to search by name, type of service provided or location. Instead of having to read and search through a pdf to try and find the information you are looking for, this tool does the work for you. This makes it easier to realize the service you need might just be down the corner.</p>

          <h3>Add Your Info</h3>
          <p>If you want to see your business, local government or community service listed as part of the directory, you can either <a href='https://www.macoupinvotes.com/machform/view.php?id=11280'>submit your information online with the web application</a> or print out and mail in your application. Your information will be added at the next update.</p>

          <h3>How It Started</h3>
          <p>Launched by <a href='http://macoupincountyil.gov/county_clerk.htm'>Macoupin County Clerk Pete Duncan</a>, Macoupin Directory started as an idea brought by the Carlinville Winning Communities organization. They asked the County to help find a way to provide an online source for people to find the services they were seeking across the County. Duncan worked with that group to bring together this online tool to achieve that goal and more.</p>
